# Edge Linking (Using Hough Transform)
<h2> Purpose </h2> Link gaps in edges after passing image through any edge detection algorithm (Sobel, Canny, Prewitt, etc). This will allow formation of clear and complete boundaries which will increase accuracy of functions requiring edges of an image as input.<br>
<h2> Requirements and Installation </h2> VSCode or Python IDLE, Libraries : numpy, opencv-python, flask. To open run app.py and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 <br>
